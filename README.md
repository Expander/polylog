Polylog
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Expander/polylog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Expander/polylog)

The Polylog package provides Rust implementations of real and complex
polylogarithms.

The Polylog package depends on the `num` crate.


Example
-------

```rust
extern crate num;
extern crate polylog;
use num::complex::Complex;
use polylog::{Li2, Li3, Li4, Li5, Li6};

fn main() {
    let x = 1.0;
    let z = Complex::new(1.0, 1.0);
    println!("Li2({}) = {}", x, x.li2());
    println!("Li2({}) = {}", z, z.li2());
    println!("Li3({}) = {}", z, z.li3());
    println!("Li4({}) = {}", z, z.li4());
    println!("Li5({}) = {}", z, z.li5());
    println!("Li6({}) = {}", z, z.li6());
}
```


Notes
-----

The implementation of the real dilogarithm has been taken from the
[ROOT](root.cern.ch) package, licensed under the GNU LGPL.  The
original implementation was written by K.S. KÃ¶lbig and published in
the CERNLIB DILOG function C332.

The implementation of the complex dilogarithm has been taken from
[SPheno](spheno.hepforge.org) and has been translated to Rust.
